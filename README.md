A growing number of cases have proven that machine learning algorithms demonstrate racial and gender biases, oftentimes reflecting deeply entrenched societal prejudices. This is particularly worrisome in the context of the healthcare industry, where unfair decisions can cost lives. Machine learning technologies have a growing impact on this sector through many applications, ranging from image recognition for disease detection to precision medicine based on genomic data. However, machine learning can play a critical role on the patientâ€™s experience even before they step into the clinic; appointments can now be scheduled by machines rather than humans in ways that optimize clinic performance, as measured by the patient and provider wait times. More specifically, algorithms predict the patients with the greatest no-show risk and then place such patients in overbooked appointment slots.
